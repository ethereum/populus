Introduction
------------

Populus provides a command line interface for contract deployments which is
suitable for simple contract deployments which do not involve constructor
arguments as well as APIs for performing more complex deployments using python.


Deploying A Contract with the Command Line
------------------------------------------

Deployment is handled through the ``$ populus deploy`` command.  All of the
following are handled automatically.

#. Selection of which chain should be deployed to.
#. Running the given chain.
#. Compilation of project contracts.
#. Derivation of library dependencies.
#. Library linking.
#. Individual contract deployment.


Lets deploy a simple Wallet contract.  First we'll need a contract in our
project ``./contracts`` directory.

.. code-block:: solidity

	// ./contracts/Wallet.sol
	contract Wallet {
		mapping (address => uint) public balanceOf;

		function deposit() {
			balanceOf[msg.sender] += 1;
		}

		function withdraw(uint value) {
			if (balanceOf[msg.sender] < value) throw;
			balanceOf[msg.sender] -= value;
			if (!msg.sender.call.value(value)()) throw;
		}
	}


We can deploy this contract to a local test chain like this:

.. code-block:: shell

	$ populus deploy Wallet -c local_a
	Beginning contract deployment.  Deploying 1 total contracts (1 Specified, 0 because of library dependencies).

Above you can see the output for a basic deployment.

If your are outside the project directory, use:

.. code-block:: shell

	$ populus -p /path/to/my/project deploy Wallet -c local_a



Programmatically deploy a contract
----------------------------------

You can also deploy contracts using a Python script. This is a suitable method
if your contracts take constructor arguments or need more complex
initialization calls.

Example (``deploy_testnet.py``):

.. code-block:: python

    """Deploy Edgeless token and smart contract in testnet.

    A simple Python script to deploy contracts and then do a smoke test for them.
    """

    from populus.utils.wait import wait_for_transaction_receipt
    from web3 import Web3


    def check_successful_tx(web3: Web3, txid: str, timeout=180) -> dict:
        """See if transaction went through (Solidity code did not throw).

        :return: Transaction receipt
        """

        # http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/6007/620
        receipt = wait_for_transaction_receipt(web3, txid, timeout=timeout)
        txinfo = web3.eth.getTransaction(txid)

        # EVM has only one error mode and it's consume all gas
        assert txinfo["gas"] != receipt["gasUsed"]
        return receipt
