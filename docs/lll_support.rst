LLL Support
===========

Populus provides partial support for LLL, in particular the
``lllc`` compiler, which is currently maintained in tandem
with Solidity and its ``solc`` compiler in the
`ethereum/solidity`_ repository.

Known limitations
-----------------

This feature is highly experimental!

Mixing different languages, e.g. Solidity and LLL or Viper and
LLL, is not yet possible.

Since LLL is very low-level, not all language constructs are
currently supported. In particular, string literals, especially
defined with the ``lit`` keyword, may be impossible to use.
For example, code using them may compile successfully, but its
deployment in tests might fail due to Populus' inability to
determine where in the bytecode the literals have been placed,
and the ``lllc`` compiler providing no hints to that effect.

One-shot contracts that leave the destination account without
code after running are also not supported, since Populus can't
differentiate between such use cases and contracts that actually
failed to deploy.

In fact, the runtime bytecode is extracted from the compiled
bytecode (as given by ``lllc``) based solely on the signature
produced by the ``returnlll`` macro.

Finally, LLL programs have no notion of ``web3`` ABI, as it is
described in the `Ethereum Contract ABI`_ specification. For that
reason, all ``.lll`` files must have an accompanying ``.lll.abi``
file, specifying in JSON the contract's interface.

Installation
------------

On Ubuntu-based systems, the ``lllc`` compiler seems to no longer
be available in a package. You might need to `build it from source`_.

For Ubuntu 14.04, one might be shipped together with ``solc``,
available in ``solidity-ubuntu-trusty.zip`` on the `releases page`_.


On Arch Linux, an ``lll`` package is `available in AUR`_.

In general, ``lllc`` should be available in ``PATH``; or an
``LLLC_BINARY`` environment variable must be set and pointing to
the ``lllc`` executable.

To see if it's present:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ lllc --version
    LLLC, the Lovely Little Language Compiler
    Version: 0.4.19-develop.2017.12.1+commit.c4cbbb05.Linux.g++

.. _build it from source: https://media.consensys.net/installing-ethereum-compilers-61d701e78f6
.. _releases page: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases
.. _available in AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lll/


Using
-----

Automatic initialisation of a ``Greeter`` project in LLL with
``populus --init`` is not yet possible.

This section describes how to do it manually.

Change compilation backend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The compilation backend must be changed from its default in `project.json`
by placing a `backend` key in the `compilation` section, as shown below:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "7",
        "compilation": {
            "contracts_source_dirs": ["./contracts"],
            "import_remappings": [],
            "backend": {
                "class": "populus.compilation.backends.LLLBackend"
            }
        }
    }

Populus will now only compile LLL contracts in the configured ``contracts``
directories.

Copy LLL-specific Greeter contract and its ABI specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These files should be available in the `Populus repository`_, as
`Greeter.lll`_ and `Greeter.lll.abi`_.

Place them in the ``contracts`` directory of your project.

.. _Populus repository: https://github.com/ethereum/populus
.. _Greeter.lll: https://github.com/ethereum/populus/tree/master/populus/assets/Greeter.lll
.. _Greeter.lll.abi: https://github.com/ethereum/populus/tree/master/populus/assets/Greeter.lll.abi

Copy LLL-specific test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This file should be available in the `Populus repository`_, as
`test_greeter_lll.py`_.

Place it in the ``tests`` directory of your project.

Remove the Solidity/Viper ``test_greeter.py`` if it's still present, so
``pytest`` doesn't trip.

.. _test_greeter_lll.py: https://github.com/ethereum/populus/tree/master/populus/assets/test_greeter_lll.py
